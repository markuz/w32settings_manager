This is win32settings_manager.

This project aims of easy management of several settings for a 
farm of win32 (win64 could be, but I have only win32)  machines.

The project is divide into two parts, the server, which should be running 
on a 'master' machine, and the clients that are all those win32 computers
that you want to keep the settings in order.

It's intended to have the same settings on every computer, so, individual 
configurations and exceptions are not part of the project right now.

If you want to cooperate you can safely email me at Marco Antonio Islas Cruz <markuz_at_islascruz.org>.
